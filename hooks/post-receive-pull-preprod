# INSTALLATION
#
# localhost: local (developer)
# devhost: used for preprod and gitolite
# 
# cd /home/www/dev.mywebsite.com 
# git clone /home/git/repositories/mywebsite.com
# 
# - put that file in /home/git/repositories/mywebsite.com/hooks/post-receive 
# 
# The "post-receive" script is run after receive-pack has accepted a pack
# and the repository has been updated.  It is passed arguments in through
# stdin in the form
#  <oldrev> <newrev> <refname>
# For example:
#  aa453216d1b3e49e7f6f98441fa56946ddcd6a20 68f7abf4e6f922807889f52bc043ecd31b79f814 refs/heads/master

read oldrev newrev refname

branch=${refname#refs/heads/} 
dir_to_pull=/home/www/dev.mywebsite.com
mail=your@email.com


if (test "$branch" = "develop") then
	cd $dir_to_pullb
	unset GIT_DIR
	git pull origin $branch
	res="$?"
	if (test ! -z "$res") then
		echo "$dir_to_pull has been updated from $oldrev to $newrev (refname=$refname)"| mail -s "[DEPLOY OK] branch $branch " $mail
	else
		echo "error when git pull origin $branch in '$dir_to_pull'. (error=$res). When update from $oldrev to $newrev (refname=$refname)"| mail -s "[DEPLOY ERROR] branch $branch " $mail
	fi
# else
		# echo "ref != develop, nothing has been done :) "| mail -s "[DEV] /dev/null :p" $mail
fi
